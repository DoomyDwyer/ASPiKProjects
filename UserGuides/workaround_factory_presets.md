## Presets ##
Neither Cubase, Ableton Live, nor PreSonus Studio One load the Factory Presets from the Plugins themselves. I've therefore released two Zip files containing the Factory Presets as `.aupreset` and `.vstpreset` files, with the correct directory structure. For Cubase, Ableton Live and Studio One users, these need to be copied into the appropriate `Presets` directory:

### Windows: ###

- Unzip the contents of the VST Presets Zip file into `C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\VST3 Presets\`

### Mac OS ###

- Unzip the contents of the either the AU or VST Presets Zip file (or both) into `~/Library/Audio/Presets`
(where `~` means `/Users/<your username>/` in Unix lingo)

**Please Note:** The Presets should be copied to the `VST3 Presets` or `Presets` directory, keeping the directory structure from the contents of the Zip file. 

If you encounter any issues running these plugins, either on Windows or MacOS, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/DoomyDwyer/ASPiKProjects/issues). The MacOS plugins should work on all versions of MacOS >= 10.9. The Windows VST3s should work on any 64-bit Windows system.
