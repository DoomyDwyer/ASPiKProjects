## Presets ##
Cubase *won't* load the Presets from the Plugins themselves. I've therefore released a Zip file containing the Presets as `.vstpreset` files, within the correct directory structure. For Cubase users, these need to be copied into the appropriate `Presets` directory:

### Windows: ###

- Unzip the contents of the Presets Zip file into `C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\VST3 Presets\`

### Mac OS ###

- Unzip the contents of the Zip file into `~/LibraryAudio/Presets`
(where `~` means `/Users/<your username>/` in Unix lingo)

**Please Note:** The Presets should be copied to the `VST3 Presets` or `Presets` directory, keeping the directory structure from the contents of the Zip file. 

If you encounter any issues running these plugins, either on Windows or MacOS, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/DoomyDwyer/ASPiKProjects/issues). The MacOS plugins should work on all versions of MacOS >= 10.9. The Windows VST3s should work on any 64-bit Windows system.
